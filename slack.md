Our group's primary forum is Slack: [https://digpublishing.slack.com](https://digpublishing.slack.com).

For new group members, if you're already on another Slack team, adding this one is [easy](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201405046), and you'll be able to use the same Slack app you already use.

If this is your first Slack team, welcome! Slack is an instant messaging service available via web, desktop or mobile apps. It is quite fun and pretty intutive. One of the first things you'll want to do is [update your profile](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204092246-Editing-your-profile) with your title and institution so everyone knows who you are, and [set your notifications](https://my.slack.com/account/notifications) the way you want. And don't be shy, post a hello to the group, or reach out and [send direct messages to group members](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212281468-Direct-messages-and-group-DMs). We want to hear from you!

If you'd like a little more info, check out Slack's [Getting Started for New Users](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users) guide and [video series](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/202622897-Video-Guides).

*A note on email:* We originally tried an email integration too, but it didn't work and was suspended. We might try again someday as Slack-to-email tools improve. If you'd be interested in that if and when we implement it, be sure to check the box on the [sign-up form](sign-up.html).
