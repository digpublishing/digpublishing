Our group's primary forum is Slack: [https://digpublishing.slack.com](https://digpublishing.slack.com).

For new group members, if you're already on another Slack team, adding this one is [easy](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201405046), and you'll be able to use the same Slack app you already use.

If this is your first Slack team, welcome! Slack is an instant messaging service available via web, desktop or mobile apps. It is quite fun and intutive, and once in it is easy to ask questions of folks there. But if you'd like a little more info, you might want to check out Slack's [Getting Started for New Users](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users) guide, or the [video series](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/202622897-Video-Guides).

If you're still not convinced and would prefer to go the old fashioned inbox route, we've also added email integration to the primary Slack #general channel. You'll be added to this by checking off the "email" box when signing-up. Or by emailing the group moderators if you've already signed-up and want to switch. Please note however that this feature is in the beta phase, and we're not sure how or if it will work out. Slack is an instant messaging service, and so rather chatty relative to email or listserv posts. With this email integration, Slack messages are automatically grouped to send every so often, but it may prove to be too much. Also note, emails are only sent from the #general discussion channel. Conversations in other channels are only available on Slack.
