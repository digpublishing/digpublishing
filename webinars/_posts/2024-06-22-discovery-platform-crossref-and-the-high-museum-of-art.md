Crossref allows publishers to register their content, assign persistent identifiers (DOIs) to their work, and submit rich metadata so that others, from researchers to funders to library discovery systems, can more easily search and discover research. Susan Collins (Community Engagement Manager) and Jennifer Kemp (Head of Partnerships) will discuss how Crossref makes research outputs easy to find, cite, assess, and reuse. 

Ivey Rucket (Manager of Web and New Media) and Angela Jaeger (Senior Manager of Creative Services) from the High Museum of Art will present [LINK](https://high.org/link/), the High’s new digital publishing platform. Built on WordPress, LINK allows for footnotes, time-based media, interactive content, and faceted search and syncs with the High’s collection management system, TMS.
