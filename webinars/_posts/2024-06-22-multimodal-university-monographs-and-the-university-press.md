A presentation on "Multimodal Digital Monographs: Content, Collaboration, Community," a report on the findings of a 2021 summit co-hosted by Brown and Emory on enhanced and interactive digital publications. 

Allison Levy, Digital Scholarship Editor at Brown University Library’s Digital Publications Initiative, provides an overview of the Mellon- and NEH-supported Initiative and shares major takeaways from the report, which she  co-authored with Sarah McKee of Emory University. The report calls for continued experimentation with new scholarly forms, as well as greater inclusion, equity, and access in the digital development and dissemination of humanities scholarship. The second half features one of the report's case studies and the Initiative’s newest publication, *A New Vision for Islamic Pasts and Futures* by Shahzad Bashir, Aga Khan Professor of Islamic Humanities and Professor of History and Religious Studies at Brown University. In conversation with Victoria Hindley, Acquisitions Editor for Visual Culture and Design at the MIT Press, Allison discusses the book’s innovative integration of form and content as well as the cross-institutional collaboration between Brown Library and MIT Press.
