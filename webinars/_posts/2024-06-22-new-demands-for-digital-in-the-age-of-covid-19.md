This hour-long webinar begins with a brief overview of new resources being developed to share with the MuPuDIG community, including a database of museum digital publications and a checklist of ideas for improving findability of online publications. 

Following is an open a discussion of how museum publishersâ€™ work is being affected by the current COVID-19 crisis quarantine and closures. Three questions are posed to the webinar participants as points of departure for discussion:

1. Are you repurposing existing content for digital access (e.g., pdfs of print publications, publicizing backlist, etc.)?

2. Are you generating new digital content for your institution (e.g., a blog, online exhibitions)?

3 Are you educating your colleagues (or yourself?) about digital publishing tools or strategy?
