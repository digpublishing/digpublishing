Originally presented on April 16, 2024, this hour-long webinar features a presentation by Liz Neely, Curator of Digital Experience at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum, on recent projects focused on publishing relationships between art, archive, and historic home collections to cultivate an ecosystem that includes browser-based inquiry, integrated digital publishing, and data visualization. Neely will discuss how this work on [Collections Online](https://collections.okeeffemuseum.org/) and the publication [Exhibiting O'Keeffe](https://publications.okeeffemuseum.org/exhibiting-okeeffe/) is informing the development of a Georgia O'Keeffe digital catalogue raisonné that promises to redefine engagement with the iconic artist's oeuvre.
