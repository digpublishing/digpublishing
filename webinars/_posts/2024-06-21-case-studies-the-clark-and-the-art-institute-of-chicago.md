Presents case studies on two projects: The Clark Art Institute’s *Journal of the Clark* and the Art Institute of Chicago’s *Malangatana: Mozambique Modern*.

Anne Roecklein (Managing Editor, Clark Art Institute) discusses the Clark’s first foray into digital publishing—the production of an annual membership journal in parallel print and digital formats using the Publitas platform.  

Ben Bertin (Production Coordinator, Art Institute of Chicago) and Robin Hoffman (Editor, AIC) discuss how they balanced continuity and innovation while creating the digital publication *Malangatana: Mozambique Modern*, the last in a series of three exhibition catalogues and the first produced on a platform developed for the purpose on the Art Institute’s website.
