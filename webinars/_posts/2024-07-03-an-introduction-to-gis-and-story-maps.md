This hour-long webinar features Maia Somers, the GIS Technician at Western Libraries at the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada, who works to help researchers communicate their data through maps. Maia introduces Story Maps as a storytelling platform, and explores how museums and other cultural organizations might use GIS (Geographic Information Systems) applications to create dynamic map-based presentations that create new context for artworks and artists.
