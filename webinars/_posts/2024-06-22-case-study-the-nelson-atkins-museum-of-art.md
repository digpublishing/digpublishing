In this webinar, the team from the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art reflects on the one-year anniversary of the serial launch of *[French Paintings and Pastels, 1600–1945: The Collections of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art](https://www.nelson-atkins.org/fpc/)*. Stephanie Alger (Digital Publishing Assistant), Brigid Boyle (Block Family Foundation Doctoral Fellow), and Meghan Gray (Project Manager, Curatorial Associate in European Arts) give an overview of this unique project, published in monthly installments. They share the lessons they learned through the planning stages of the publication, and why they decided on their serial approach. Learn about the work that goes into each launch, see statistics on audience reach, and hear about the museum’s strategies for publicizing the book.
