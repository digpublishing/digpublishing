A deep dive into the editorial approach taken with [Proyecto Mission Murals](https://www.sfmoma.org/publication/mission-murals/), the latest digital publication from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Kari Dahlgren, Director of Publications, discusses how the project was conceived and why it made sense for SFMOMA to do it, how the museum worked with a community advisory group to shape the content, and how they approached the bilingual aspect of the publication.
