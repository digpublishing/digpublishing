This hour-long webinar features the team behind the project “Mapping Dutch Art in the United States,” ([https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbU5pTU9sLUs5Vzh5VEpwSkc1Q2ZUSDRwaEVCQXxBQ3Jtc0trbm40UGd3cUpacFgzdEJERVE1TFNVbkdSMlhiay0tNzEza3ZBdFk1YnZGNkVYRHc2S0pQa2pzblREOUUwNFVGYkJsWXdDRms2cUxwb0liQ204YXlTVVZfRmFUUzE0d1NsOUhiZVVpeXVRS2RpQWdnOA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fstorymaps.arcgis.com%2Fstories%2F356cbe039a89402e837cacc8fccf216a&v=mFG915SprbA)) including Elizabeth Mathews-Kern, Lead Project Developer; Christopher Atkins, Van Otterloo-Weatherbie Director of the Center for Netherlandish Art at the MFA Boston; and Alyssa Trejo, former Coordinator at the Center for Netherlandish Art. Made in collaboration with the Consulate General of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in New York, the digital map helps users identify and locate museums in the United States that collect and display 17th-century Dutch art. During the webinar, the team discusses how the project came together, the construction of the ArcGIS StoryMap, and the challenges and successes that arose while working with internal and external partners.
