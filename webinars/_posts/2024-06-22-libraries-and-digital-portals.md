A focus on how libraries and digital portals are responding to trends in digital publishing.

Lee Sorensen (Librarian for Visual Studies and Dance, Duke University Libraries) shares perspectives on how university librarians and researchers are finding and using digital resources, including how usage has changed during the pandemic.

Patricia Fidler (Executive Director, A&AePortal, Yale University Press) discusses insights that Yale has gathered through the process of setting up the [A&AePortal](https://aaeportal.com/?id=-827&cid=-827): How has the landscape changed since the early stages of the project? What patterns have emerged while working with libraries? Has this changed with COVID?
