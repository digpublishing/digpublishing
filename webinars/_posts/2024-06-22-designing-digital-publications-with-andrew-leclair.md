Designer Andrew LeClair shares the unique perspective that he brings to digital publications and museum publishing workflows. He shares his work on the online publications [In Terms of Performance](http://intermsofperformance.site/) and *[A Steady Pulse: Restaging Lucinda Childs, 1963-1978](http://danceworkbook.pcah.us/asteadypulse/)* for the Pew Center for Arts & Heritage and *[Altered States: Etching in Late 19th-Century Paris](https://risdmuseum.org/art-design/projects-publications/publications/altered-states-1)* for the RISD Museum, all of which reveal a deep interconnection between content and the possibilities of design in a digital space. He also shares his work with E Roon Kang on 908A, a research initiative that focuses on constructing new algorithmic design tools in partnership with museums. Projects and prototypes underway include new workflows for generating printed materials (labels, large-print brochures, etc.) pulling directly from collections data, and initial research on generating book-length publications directly from website content.
