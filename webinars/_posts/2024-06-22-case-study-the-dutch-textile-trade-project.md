This talk features the [Dutch Textile Trade Project]((https://dutchtextiletrade.org/)), which recently debuted with a special issue of the [Journal of Historians of Netherlandish Art](www.jhna.org). Marsely Kehoe, PhD, an independent scholar and member of the board of Historians of Netherlandish Art, and Carrie Anderson, PhD, associate professor of art history at Middlebury College, share their work on the project, which traces the movement of textiles across the Dutch trading network in the 17th and 18th centuries. It incorporates open access data, data visualization apps, and a visual textile glossary.
