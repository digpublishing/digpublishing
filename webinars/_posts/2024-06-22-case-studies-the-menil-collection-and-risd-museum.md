Case studies of digital publications developed by two publication teams who found ways to work creatively with limited staff resources.

The *Raid the Icebox Now* exhibition opened at the RISD Museum in September 2019, and was accompanied by a unique [digital publication](https://publications.risdmuseum.org/raid-icebox-now). Developed in response to each of the artists participating in the exhibition, the publication features new writings and multimedia projects by each of them. Jeremy Radtke, Assistant Director, Digital Initiatives, discusses some of the technical and design challenges faced in developing the book, as well as its successes.

The Menil Collection publishing department, which lacks a dedicated digital staff, developed a [Read Online](https://www.menil.org/read) section of their website to host two longer digital features produced as special projects as well as shorter articles, with plans for expansion. In this talk, Joseph Newland, Director of Publishing, will focus on the "why should this be digital?" aspects of the special-project features.
