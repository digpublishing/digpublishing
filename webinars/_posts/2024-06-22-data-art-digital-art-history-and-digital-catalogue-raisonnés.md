Samantha Deutch (The Frick Collection) and Michelle Wilson (Columbia University) present on the [Digital Art History Directory](https://dahd.hcommons.org/digital-art-history-directory/?order=DESC&orderby=date&view_mode=cards&perpage=12&paged=1&fetch_only=thumbnail%2Ccreation_date%2Ctitle%2Cdescription&fetch_only_meta=), a project of the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA). This emerging publication and tool seeks to define, promote, and build community around the discipline of digital art history. Deutch and Wilson share the history of the project and the development of the online directory as well as how museum publishers may benefit from and contribute to the DAHD.

Caitlin Sweeney (Wildenstein Plattner Institute) discusses the WPI’s inaugural digital publication, the [Tom Wesselmann Digital Corpus](https://digitalprojects.wpi.art/wesselmann/introduction); the forthcoming [digital catalogue raisonné of Gauguin’s Tahitian paintings](https://digitalprojects.wpi.art/gauguin/introduction); and the WPI’s experiences turning a venerated genre of art historical reference into a dynamic and accessible online tool.
