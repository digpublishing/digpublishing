In this hour-long webinar, Andi Back (associate librarian/fine arts and humanities librarian, University of Kansas) and Maya Stiller, PhD (associate professor, Korean art and visual culture, University of Kansas) discuss how we can get our digital publications into the hands of researchers and students. During their presentation Maya and Andi discuss what types of museum publications researchers are most interested in, what formats of digital publishing are most accessible for scholars, and whether publishing behind a paywall affects the usage of publications.
