The first webinar of the Museum Publishing Digital Interest Group (MuPuDIG), focusing on projects presented at the 2019 MCN conference. 

First, members of the publishing teams from the Art Institute of Chicago, Getty Publications, National Gallery of Art, and Philadelphia Museum of Art will introduce a [joint evaluation ](https://digpublishing.github.io/catalogues-study/)of their online scholarly collection catalogues, highlighting significant findings. 

Then, Alex Bortolot and Kris Thayer from the Minneapolis Institute of Art will share insights into how their team used the multiplatform publishing tool Quire to create the collaborative publication *[Alcoholâ€™s Empire: Distilled Spirits in the 1700s Atlantic World](https://new.artsmia.org/alcohols-empire)*. You can also access their project case study for a more in-depth look behind the scenes.
