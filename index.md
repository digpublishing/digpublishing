### Hi!

Welcome to the Museum Publishing Digital Interest Group (MuPuDIG), founded by and for museum publishers interested in how emerging digital platforms and processes impact our work. Since 2020, we have hosted dozens of webinars featuring case studies, deep dives on topics like accessibility and new digital platforms, and roundtable conversations, including presenters from institutions large and small and innovators from outside of the museum field. 

In the process, we've developed a rich array of resources for museum professionals interested in taking the leap into digital publications. Sign up for our mailing list to keep informed about upcoming webinars, and explore resources here.
