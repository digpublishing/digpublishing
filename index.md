### Hi!

Welcome to the Museum Publishing Digital Interest Group (MuPuDIG), founded by and for museum publishers interested in how emerging digital platforms and processes impact our work. Since 2020, we have hosted dozens of webinars featuring different community members sharing their projects and ideas, and inviting innovators from outside of the museum field to share new models. 

In the process, we've developed a rich array of resources for museum professionals interested in taking the leap into digital publications. Sign up for our mailing list to be informed about upcoming webinars, and explore resources here.
