MuPuDIG is open to anyone interested in learning more about digital publishing in museums, regardless of their technical expertise. Join our community!

* Sign up for our [mailing list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1giqehpBLBvnr-eSxCM4ewTWQlGirYjnQYY5ExDexOWA/edit?usp=drive_link), so you never miss announcements about forthcoming webinars.
* Join the Museum Publishing Digital Interest Group Slack workspace ([https://digpublishing.slack.com)](https://digpublishing.slack.com) to share news or ask for advice. [](https://digpublishing.slack.com)

  * If you're already on another Slack team, adding this one is [easy](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201405046), and you'll be able to use the same Slack app you already use.
  * If this is your first Slack team, one of the first things you'll want to do is [update your profile](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204092246-Editing-your-profile) with your title and institution so everyone knows who you are, and [set your notifications](https://my.slack.com/account/notifications) the way you want. And don't be shy, post a hello to the group, or reach out and [send direct messages to group members](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212281468-Direct-messages-and-group-DMs). 
* Attend our bimonthly webinars, and explore past presentations on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mupudig) channel.
